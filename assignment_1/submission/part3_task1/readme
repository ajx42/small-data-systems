PageRank Implementation is provided in `task1.py`.

Please note that the following settings under the USER_CONFIGURATION section in task1.py needed to be updated before running.

1. Dataset Selection: The application can be used to process Berkeley-Stanford and Wikipedia datasets. Uncomment the relevant lines in the configuration sections.
2. DEBUG Flag: The application allows printing output ranks to stdout. It is generally not a good idea to do this with the Wikipedia dataset, although it can be.
3. APP_NAME: Give a name to the application so that it can be identified easily on the webUIs. 
4. SPARK_MASTER: Update the URL to point to the spark master of your cluster.
5. HDFS_OUTPUT_PATH: Provide an appropriate output directory to write data to. 

Once the configuration is done. Use `run.sh` as follows to run the application. The output will be written to the provided output directory.

```
SPARK_HOME_DIR=/path/to/spark/ ./run.sh

```
