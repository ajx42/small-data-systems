# Task 2

To execute the code, execute `./run_task2.sh` from the terminal. The default partitioning
will be 105 partitions. To modify this value (e.g. to test the other values considered in
report such as 30 and 210), modify the `parts` variable in the `run_task2.sh` file.

Note `run_task2.sh` should be executable. If not, execute `chmod +x run_task2.sh`
in the terminal.
